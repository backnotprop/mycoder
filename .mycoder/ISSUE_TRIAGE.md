# Issue Triage Guidelines

## Issue Classification

When triaging a new issue, categorize it by type and apply appropriate labels:

### Issue Types
- **Bug**: An error, flaw, or unexpected behavior in the code
- **Feature**: A request for new functionality or capability
- **Request**: A general request that doesn't fit into bug or feature categories

### Issue Labels
- **bug**: For issues reporting bugs or unexpected behavior
- **documentation**: For issues related to documentation improvements
- **question**: For issues asking questions about usage or implementation
- **duplicate**: For issues that have been reported before (link to the original issue)
- **enhancement**: For feature requests or improvement suggestions
- **help wanted**: For issues that need additional community input or assistance

## Triage Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
1. Read the issue description thoroughly
2. Determine if the issue provides sufficient information
   - If too vague, ask for more details (reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior)
   - Check for screenshots, error messages, or logs if applicable

### Step 2: Categorization
1. Assign the appropriate issue type (Bug, Feature, Request)
2. Apply relevant labels based on the issue content

### Step 3: Duplication Check
1. Search for similar existing issues
2. If a duplicate is found:
   - Apply the "duplicate" label
   - Comment with a link to the original issue
   - Suggest closing the duplicate issue

### Step 4: Issue Investigation

#### For Bug Reports:
1. Attempt to reproduce the issue if possible
2. Investigate the codebase to identify potential causes
3. Provide initial feedback on:
   - Potential root causes
   - Affected components
   - Possible solutions or workarounds
   - Estimation of complexity

#### For Feature Requests:
1. Evaluate if the request aligns with the project's goals
2. Investigate feasibility and implementation approaches
3. Provide feedback on:
   - Implementation possibilities
   - Potential challenges
   - Similar existing functionality
   - Estimation of work required

#### For Questions:
1. Research the code and documentation to find answers
2. Provide clear and helpful responses
3. Suggest documentation improvements if the question reveals gaps

### Step 5: Follow-up
1. Provide a constructive and helpful comment
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Suggest next steps or potential contributors
4. Set appropriate expectations for resolution timeframes

## Communication Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive in all communications
- Acknowledge the issue reporter's contribution
- Use clear and specific language
- Provide context for technical suggestions
- Link to relevant documentation when applicable
- Encourage community participation when appropriate

## Special Considerations

- For security vulnerabilities, suggest proper disclosure channels
- For major feature requests, suggest discussion in appropriate forums first
- For issues affecting performance, request benchmark data if not provided
- For platform-specific issues, request environment details
