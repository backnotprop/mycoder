# Release Process with semantic-release-monorepo\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project uses `semantic-release-monorepo` to automate the versioning and release process across all packages in the monorepo. This ensures that each package is versioned independently based on its own changes, while maintaining a consistent release process.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. When code is pushed to the `release` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.\n2. The workflow builds and tests all packages.\n3. `semantic-release-monorepo` analyzes the commit history for each package to determine the next version.\n4. New versions are published to npm, and release notes are generated based on conventional commits.\n5. Git tags are created for each package release.\n\n## Commit Message Format\n\nThis project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Your commit messages should be structured as follows:\n\n`\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n`\n\nExamples:\n\n`\nfeat(cli): add new command for project initialization\nfix(agent): resolve issue with async tool execution\ndocs: update installation instructions\n`\n\n### Types\n\n- `feat`: A new feature (triggers a minor version bump)\n- `fix`: A bug fix (triggers a patch version bump)\n- `docs`: Documentation changes\n- `style`: Changes that don't affect the code's meaning (formatting, etc.)\n- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature\n- `perf`: Performance improvements\n- `test`: Adding or correcting tests\n- `chore`: Changes to the build process, tooling, etc.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\nIf your commit introduces a breaking change, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer followed by a description of the change. This will trigger a major version bump.\n\nExample:\n\n`\nfeat(agent): change API for tool execution\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: The tool execution API now requires an options object instead of individual parameters.\n`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with the release process:\n\n1. Run `pnpm verify-release-config` to check if your semantic-release configuration is correct.\n2. Ensure your commit messages follow the conventional commits format.\n3. Check if the package has a `.releaserc.json` file that extends `semantic-release-monorepo`.\n4. Verify that each package has a `semantic-release` script in its `package.json`.\n\n## Manual Release\n\nIn rare cases, you might need to trigger a release manually. You can do this by:\n\n`bash\n# Release all packages\npnpm release\n\n# Release a specific package\ncd packages/cli\npnpm semantic-release\n`\n
