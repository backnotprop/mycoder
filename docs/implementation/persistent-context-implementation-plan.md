# Persistent Context Management Implementation Plan

This document outlines a plan for implementing a persistent context management system in mycoder that achieves the benefits of Roo Code's Memory Bank while prioritizing human-readable documentation.

## Goals

1. Maintain persistent context across user sessions
2. Prioritize human-readable documentation
3. Integrate with existing development workflows
4. Minimize additional maintenance burden
5. Provide rich context for the AI assistant

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a documentation-first approach with lightweight AI-specific enhancements.

### Phase 1: Documentation Standards and Templates

**Objective**: Establish documentation standards and templates that serve both human and AI needs.

**Tasks**:
1. Define a recommended documentation structure:
   - README.md - Project overview and getting started
   - ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture and design principles
   - DECISIONS.md - Architectural decision records
   - ROADMAP.md - Future plans and direction
   - CHANGELOG.md - Record of changes and versions
   - docs/ - Directory for detailed documentation

2. Create templates for each document type:
   - Include structured sections with clear headings
   - Add optional front matter for metadata
   - Provide examples of well-structured documentation

3. Develop documentation generation capabilities:
   - Implement commands to scaffold documentation
   - Create functionality to update existing documentation
   - Build tools to extract information from code

**Deliverables**:
- Documentation templates
- Documentation style guide
- Documentation generation commands

### Phase 2: Context Indexing System

**Objective**: Develop a lightweight indexing system that helps the AI navigate project documentation.

**Tasks**:
1. Design a minimal index format:
   - Map document types to file paths
   - Track document sections and headings
   - Store last-updated timestamps
   - Include document summaries

2. Implement index generation:
   - Parse existing documentation
   - Extract structure and metadata
   - Generate index file (.mycoder-index.json)

3. Build index maintenance:
   - Update index when documentation changes
   - Handle file additions and removals
   - Track documentation coverage

**Deliverables**:
- Index file format specification
- Index generation tool
- Index update mechanism

### Phase 3: Version Control Integration

**Objective**: Leverage Git history and GitHub artifacts for additional context.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement Git history analysis:
   - Parse commit messages
   - Track file changes over time
   - Identify significant commits

2. Develop GitHub integration:
   - Connect to GitHub API
   - Retrieve issues and PRs
   - Extract context from discussions

3. Create a unified context model:
   - Combine documentation and version control data
   - Prioritize information by relevance
   - Resolve conflicts between sources

**Deliverables**:
- Git history parser
- GitHub API integration
- Unified context model

### Phase 4: Context-Aware AI Interaction

**Objective**: Enable the AI to effectively use the persistent context.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement context retrieval:
   - Develop algorithms to find relevant context
   - Create efficient search capabilities
   - Prioritize context based on query

2. Build context injection:
   - Insert relevant context into AI prompts
   - Manage context window limitations
   - Track context usage

3. Develop context updates:
   - Update documentation based on interactions
   - Suggest documentation improvements
   - Maintain documentation quality

**Deliverables**:
- Context retrieval system
- Context injection mechanism
- Documentation update tools

### Phase 5: User Interface and Control

**Objective**: Provide users with visibility and control over the context system.

**Tasks**:
1. Create context visualization:
   - Show what context is being used
   - Highlight sources of information
   - Indicate confidence levels

2. Implement context controls:
   - Allow users to include/exclude context sources
   - Provide options to refresh or update context
   - Enable manual context prioritization

3. Develop documentation management:
   - Build tools to review AI-generated documentation
   - Create interfaces for editing and approving changes
   - Implement documentation quality checks

**Deliverables**:
- Context visualization UI
- Context control settings
- Documentation management tools

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 12-17 weeks

## Success Metrics

1. **Context Retention**: AI maintains accurate understanding across sessions
2. **Documentation Quality**: Generated documentation follows best practices
3. **User Satisfaction**: Users report improved AI assistance
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Minimal additional work required from developers
5. **Integration**: Seamless fit with existing development workflows

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Documentation overload | High | Medium | Focus on essential documentation, provide clear templates |
| Context inaccuracy | High | Medium | Implement verification mechanisms, allow user corrections |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Optimize indexing and retrieval, implement caching |
| User resistance | Medium | Medium | Ensure clear benefits, minimize additional work |
| API limitations | Medium | Low | Design for resilience, implement fallbacks |

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a path to creating a persistent context management system that achieves the benefits of Roo Code's Memory Bank while prioritizing human-readable documentation. By following a documentation-first approach with lightweight AI enhancements, mycoder can provide excellent context retention without creating parallel AI-specific knowledge bases.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with each phase building on the previous one. The end result will be a system that enhances AI capabilities while producing documentation that remains valuable independent of the AI assistant.
