# MyCoder

MyCoder is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you accomplish a wide range of coding tasks through natural language commands. It's designed to understand your project context, implement features, fix bugs, and transform code based on your instructions.

## What is MyCoder?

MyCoder is a command-line tool that uses AI to help you with software development tasks. By understanding your project's structure and requirements, MyCoder can autonomously execute complex coding tasks that would typically require significant manual effort.

Currently available as a research preview, MyCoder is built to work alongside developers, enhancing productivity while maintaining full control over the development process.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered**: Supports multiple AI providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral AI, xAI/Grok, and Ollama
- **Extensible Tool System**: Includes tools for file operations, shell commands, web browsing, and more
- **Parallel Execution**: Can spawn sub-agents to work on different parts of a task simultaneously
- **Self-Modification**: Capable of modifying code, including its own codebase
- **Smart Logging**: Hierarchical, color-coded logging for clear visibility into actions
- **Human-Compatible**: Works with standard project structures without special formatting
- **Configuration System**: Persistent configuration options to customize behavior
- **GitHub Integration**: Optional GitHub mode for working with issues and PRs
- **Custom Prompts**: Ability to customize the system prompt for specialized behavior

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OS: MacOS, Windows, or Linux
- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- An API key for your chosen AI provider

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mycoder

# Or use with npx
npx mycoder
```

For detailed installation instructions for macOS and Linux, including how to set up Node.js using NVM, [see our installation guide](installation.md).

### Supported AI Providers

MyCoder supports multiple AI providers:

| Provider   | Environment Variable | Models                               |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Anthropic  | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, etc. |
| OpenAI     | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | gpt-4o, o3-mini, etc.                |
| Mistral AI | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`    | mistral-large, mistral-medium, etc.  |
| xAI/Grok   | `XAI_API_KEY`        | grok-1                               |
| Ollama     | N/A (local)          | Various local models                 |

You can specify which provider and model to use with the `--modelProvider` and `--modelName` options:

```bash
mycoder --modelProvider openai --modelName gpt-4o "Your prompt here"
```

Or set them as defaults in your configuration:

```bash
mycoder config set modelProvider openai
mycoder config set modelName gpt-4o
```

### Setting Up Your API Key

Before using MyCoder with a specific provider, you need to provide the appropriate API key:

1. Set an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   # or
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   # or
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key
   # or
   export XAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in your working directory with the appropriate key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

You can obtain API keys from the respective provider websites.

## Basic Usage

### Running with a Prompt

The simplest way to use MyCoder is to provide a natural language prompt:

```bash
mycoder "Fix all TypeScript build errors and ensure tests pass"
```

### Interactive Mode

You can run MyCoder in interactive mode for ongoing conversation:

```bash
mycoder -i
```

### Reading Prompts from Files

For complex tasks, you can prepare your prompt in a file:

```bash
mycoder --file=my-task-description.txt
```

### Performance Profiling

You can enable performance profiling to diagnose startup times and identify bottlenecks:

```bash
# Enable profiling for any command
mycoder --profile "Fix the build errors"

# Or use with other commands
mycoder --profile --interactive
```

The profiling output shows detailed timing information for each initialization step:

```
ðŸ“Š Performance Profile:
=======================
Module initialization: 10.12ms (10.12ms)
After imports: 150.34ms (140.22ms)
Main function start: 269.99ms (119.65ms)
After dotenv config: 270.10ms (0.11ms)
After Sentry init: 297.57ms (27.48ms)
Before package.json load: 297.57ms (0.00ms)
After package.json load: 297.78ms (0.21ms)
Before yargs setup: 297.78ms (0.00ms)
After yargs setup: 401.45ms (103.67ms)
Total startup time: 401.45ms
=======================
```

This is particularly useful for diagnosing performance differences between operating systems.

### Custom Prompt

The `customPrompt` configuration option allows you to append custom instructions to the system prompt used by MyCoder. This can be useful for guiding the AI's behavior for your specific use cases:

```bash
# Example: Set a custom prompt to prefer TypeScript
mycoder config set customPrompt "Always use TypeScript when writing code. Prefer functional programming patterns when possible."
```

The custom prompt will be included in both the main agent and any sub-agents that are created.

### GitHub Mode

MyCoder supports GitHub integration through the `githubMode` configuration option. When enabled, MyCoder will:

- Work with GitHub issues and PRs as part of its workflow
- Create branches for issues it's working on
- Make commits with descriptive messages
- Create PRs when work is complete

To enable GitHub mode:

```bash
mycoder config set githubMode true
```

This requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated. For more details, see the GitHub Mode documentation.

## Best Practices

### Providing Context

MyCoder works best when it has clear context about your project:

1. Ensure your project has a descriptive README.md
2. Be specific about file paths in your prompts
3. Explain any non-standard patterns or conventions

### Task Complexity

For optimal results with complex tasks:

1. Start with smaller, well-defined tasks
2. Build up to more complex changes as you get comfortable
3. For major refactorings, consider a step-by-step approach

### Security Considerations

Since MyCoder can execute any command on your system:

1. Review the actions MyCoder proposes before confirming them
2. Use in trusted codebases and environments
3. Be cautious when allowing network access or third-party tool installation

## Limitations

As a research preview, MyCoder has some limitations:

1. **Context Window**: Limited by Claude's context window size, which may affect reasoning about very large codebases

2. **Language Model Limitations**: May occasionally produce hallucinations or misunderstandings

3. **Tool Constraints**: Some tools have built-in constraints (like file size limits) to prevent resource issues

4. **External Dependencies**: Requires an internet connection to access the Claude API

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues or have questions about MyCoder:

1. Join the [MyCoder Discord community](https://discord.gg/5K6TYrHGHt) for support
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder) for documentation and updates
3. Use the `--help` command line option for quick reference
